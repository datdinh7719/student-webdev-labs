# Reflection Document

## 01-HTML

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to do all of the html exercises in lab1 with the materials that we learned in class. I watched the video afterward to double check my work.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I think all four exercises were useful because they each went over a type of commonly used html element. Between list, image, table, and form, I would guess that table would be the least used one, while the other 3 would be used very often on a webpage. I found that using fieldset inr a form to be very useful as well as it allows us to group together several selections such as a set of radio buttons.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I think everything was very clear between the lecture and the lab video. The concept that we used in this lab matches very closely with what we went over during the lecture.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I would have liked to gain more exposure to more semantic html elements that we can use in place of non-semantic elements such as div.

## 02-a11y

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete this exercise before watching the video and looking at the solution.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

In this exercise, we performed an accessibility check on forms that look to be correct. We found multiple issues with accessibility, where the labels are not properly linked up with the input element. I found that this exercise is helpful to teach that something that looks fine visually could be having issues with accessibility. And we need to design our website that is accessible for users with disabilities as well.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I think the video going over the lab did a very good job of explaining the lab.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think an exercise to view a website using a screen reader would be very helpful so that we view the website from the point of view of the user that needs to use an accessibility tool. This would help us to design a more accessible website because we would be able to see it in practice.

## 03-CSS

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

For these exercises, I mostly had to follow along with the video to complete them.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

These exercises were all very helpful to learn how to select different elements with CSS and applying styles to the elements. One exercise that I found particularly cool and helpful is the media queries exercise. This exercise was helpful because it taught us an important tool that allows us to build a responsive website. Building a responsive website is very important because the user can view our website from a variety of devices that have different screen sizes. Media queries allow us to apply different css styles to our html elements depending on the user’s screen size. I think media queries will be very useful and we will be using it a lot.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

It might not be directly related to these lab exercises, but I want to know more about CSS selection of html elements. I’m still a bit unsure about in what situation we should be selecting an element based on its class, id, or the element itself.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think all of the different exercises that we have in this lab were pretty comprehensive in giving an overview of what we can do with CSS.

## 04-Flexbox

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I followed along with the video to complete this lab.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I think this exercise is very helpful and important. It seems to me that flexbox can give us a lot of flexibility and is very useful for building a responsive design. This is because flexbox allows us to control the arrangement and spacing of elements. We can set spacing that changes based on the available space on a screen size, instead of setting up multiple media queries to do it manually.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I’m still a bit confused about flex-basis and what it means to set a default value for how flex items grow and shrink.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think an exercise that utilizes flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink would have been useful.

## 05-css-grid

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I followed along with the video to complete the exercises.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found css grid to be useful since it provides us with a way to set up a layout with a grid system. I think css grid can provide more versatility than flexbox since it is a two-dimensional system that can handle both rows and columns whereas flexbox is mainly one dimensional. I think grids can be very useful for websites with complex layouts.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I would like to go into more detail about the differences between grid and flexbox, and for what type of applications we should be using one over the other.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Perhaps an exercise where we create a responsive grid with auto-fill and auto-fit.

## 06-bootstrap

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I completed the bootstrap exercises by mainly following along with the videos.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found bootstrap to be very useful since it comes with a lot of pre-styled components and a very useful 12-column grid system. It was very simple to look up the pre-styled component and add it to our code using classes defined by bootstrap.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

When working with bootstrap, do we have to make sure that our user-defined classes do not already exist in bootstrap. And if we are using bootstrap, does that mean that we should only use bootstrap classes or should we also define our own style with our own classes in css properties as needed.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think it would be cool to see how to build a navbar with bootstrap vs with what we did in the past with html and css.

## 07-javascript

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I followed along with the videos to complete the javascript exercises.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found javascript to be very helpful. We can significantly reduce the amount of code that we need to write. After creating a function to add an HTML element to the DOM, we can call that function multiple times to add the element. We can also use a loop to add and delete elements. We can also modify the content by searching for and replacing strings and other operations. It’s also very similar to other languages that I’m familiar with, so that makes it very helpful. Javascript also allows us to add a lot of interactivity to our website, such as doing something based on a user’s click.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

In what situation would we want to modify the text content of a website via javascript instead of changing the source html code itself.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think some of the exercises that only deal with consoles could have more interaction with the DOM, so we can see how it would affect a website.

## 08-jquery

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I mostly followed along with the videos for these exercises.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

Jquery is very helpful in allowing us to really simplify our javascript code. In these exercises, we pretty much recreate the same code as from lab 7 but with jquery. Our code ended up being much shorter and simpler than regular javascript.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I think jquery code is a bit hard to read at first because of how concise it is.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think just having more jquery exercises so that we can get more exposure to the syntax would be helpful.
